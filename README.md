First project for CompSci 308 Fall 2015

Name: Matthew Battles

Date started: 8/26/2015

Date finished: 9/3/2015

Hours worked: 30

Resources used: Stack Overflow, higher level discussions with Steven Katsohirakis, Alex Rice, and Jasper Hancock.

Main class file: Game

Data (non Java) files needed: images, which can be found in the images folder and are referenced in the path.

How to play the game:  Avoid enemy bullets and collisions with enemies.

Keys/Mouse input: Use the up arrow key to speed up, down key to slow down, left and right arrow keys to change lanes, and space bar to fire weapon.

Cheat Keys: F freezes enemies, stopping them from spawning, moving, and firing at you. I makes you invincible to any attack. The 1 and 2 keys switch to their respective levels, and Q allows you to quit to the main screen at any time.

Known bugs: Enemies can spawn and move on top of each other, and hurt each other.

Extra features: N/A

Impressions/Suggestions: Overall I found this project to be extremely interesting and rewarding. Along with learning some JavaFX syntax, I learned the structure of video game coding, which can be very useful to me in my career path.
